# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.

# poetry
#   According to https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#publishing-and-sharing-packages,
#   it is recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   However, since poetry is not widely used at this time, we won't include it.
